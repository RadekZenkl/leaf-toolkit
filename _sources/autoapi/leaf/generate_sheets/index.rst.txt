.. py:function:: generate_sheets()

   Generates a LaTeX file and corresponding PDF containing QR-coded sample labels.

   This function prompts the user for an input text file containing sample names and an output filename.
   It then creates a LaTeX document formatted to print pages with QR codes and corresponding names.
   Each page contains up to 8 labels, and all pages are compiled into a single PDF using `pdflatex`.

   The LaTeX document includes:
       - A bordered layout with visual guides
       - QR codes for each sample
       - Sample names (formatted for LaTeX)

   User interactions include:
       - Prompt for input filename (expects a `.txt` file, one sample name per line)
       - Preview and confirmation of file content
       - Prompt for output filename (a `.tex` file)

   The function will:
       - Validate the existence of the input file
       - Process and display its contents for confirmation
       - Format the content into a LaTeX document using predefined templates
       - Write the LaTeX code to a file
       - Compile the LaTeX file to PDF using `pdflatex` with `-shell-escape`

   :raises SystemExit: If the input file is not found or if user indicates the input content is incorrect.

   Side Effects:
       - Writes a LaTeX `.tex` file to the current working directory
       - Executes a system call to `pdflatex` to generate the final PDF
